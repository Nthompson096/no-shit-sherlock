## What it does!

It utilies sherlock as the backend and the GUI as the frontend, you can find out how to install sherlock [here](https://sherlockproject.xyz/installation) as that's a dependent. 
Uses almost all of the commands (except no color terminal output).
Pretty cut and dry for now; doesn't require you to install a virtual environment.
